# CNN-Kaggle Dog Breed Identification 

I worked with the Dog Breed Identification dataset found on Kaggle in order to successfully distinguish 120 different dog breeds by implementing a convolutional neural network. For this project, I also utilized the fastai library to train my model until it generalized well. 

The dataset API and kaggle competition is listed as follows:
